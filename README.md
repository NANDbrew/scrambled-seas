# ScrambledSeas
This is a mod for Sailwind.
Scrambled Seas Randomizer

NANDbrew edition 
- [BorderExpander](https://github.com/NANDbrew/BorderExpander) integration
- scale your scramble up or down on new game
- saves island positions now instead of re-scrambling from seed every load, to shorten load times
- still scrambles new islands that aren't in the save (and then saves them)
- save can be put in a file for manual editing of island positions
  - these are offsets in meters from the vanilla positions
- includes vitalijbeam's JSON export for MoffKalast map
